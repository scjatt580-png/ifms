### 4. ✅ CRITICAL BUG FIXES

**HR Attendance Page SQL Error (FIXED)**
- **File**: [employee/hr/attendance.php](employee/hr/attendance.php)
- **Line**: 60 (previously)
- **Issue**: Backslash escaping in multi-line string literal
- **Fix**: Changed from:
  ```php
  $db->query("\
    SELECT e.id... \
  ") // ❌ Backslashes created literal \ in SQL
  ```
  To:
  ```php
  $db->query("
    SELECT e.id...
  ") // ✅ Proper multi-line string
  ```
- **Result**: Page now loads without SQL syntax error
- **Test**: HR employee clicks "Attendance" - should load data

**Finance Invoices Page SQL Error (FIXED)**
- **File**: [employee/finance/invoices.php](employee/finance/invoices.php)
- **Line**: 15 (previously)
- **Issue**: Query referenced non-existent `clients` table
- **Fix**: Changed from:
  ```php
  LEFT JOIN clients o ON c.id = o.organization_id // ❌ Table doesn't exist
  ```
  To:
  ```php
  LEFT JOIN organizations c ON i.organization_id = c.id // ✅ Correct table
  ```
- **Result**: Invoices page shows data correctly
- **Test**: Finance employee clicks "Invoices" - data displays

**Sidebar Navigation PHP Syntax Error (FIXED)**
- **File**: [includes/sidebar.php](includes/sidebar.php)
- **Lines**: 115-127 (previously)
- **Issues**: 
  1. Missing closing `</a>` tag on payroll link
  2. Premature `<?php endif; ?>` breaking conditional structure
  3. `<?php elseif` appearing after `endif`
- **Fix**: 
  - Added missing closing tags
