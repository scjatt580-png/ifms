## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Designation not loading after department selection
**Solution**: Wait 300ms for API call to complete, then dropdown auto-fills

### Issue: Cannot delete admin account
**Solution**: This is intentional for security. Only users with 'employee' role can be deleted/deactivated.

### Issue: Email already exists error
**Solution**: Use unique email - check existing employees or add suffix (test+1@company.com)

### Issue: Transaction failed error
**Solution**: Check database connection and permissions. Ensure all foreign key constraints met.
