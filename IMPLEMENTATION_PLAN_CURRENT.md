## Architecture Notes

### Database Extensions Needed
- Add `leave_date`, `leave_days`, `leave_reason` to `requests` table
- Verify `clients` table OR use `organizations` for client management
- Add `payment_status`, `resolved_at` to requests for tracking

### API Patterns
- POST-based CRUD with action parameter
- JSON responses with `success` boolean + error/message/data fields
- Role-based access control via `requireRole()` or `requireAPI()`

### UI Patterns
- Modal-based forms
- Toast notifications (showToast function)
- Modal helpers (openModal/closeModal)
- Client-side validation before API calls
- Proper error handling and user feedback
